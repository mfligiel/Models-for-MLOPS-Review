# Models-for-MLOPS-Review
Models and scripts related to trying MLOps platforms.  In order to investigate Evidently.ai and other such platforms & packages, I will first build a very simple model (predicting Chicago's weather from weather of similar cities).  From there, I will use the oferings of these platforms to see how they can detect a shift in underlying data distributions.
